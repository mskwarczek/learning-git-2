			<h2>Nightwish - Storytime</h2>
			<p>It was the night before<br>
				When all through the world<br>
				No words, no dreams<br>
				Then one day<br>
				A writer by a fire<br>
				Imagined all of Gaia<br>
				Took a journey into a child-man's heart</p>
			<p>A painter on the shore<br>
				Imagined all the world<br>
				Within a snowflake on his palm<br>
				Unframed by poetry<br>
				A canvas of awe<br>
				Planet Earth falling back into the stars</p>
			<p>I am the voice of Never-Never-Land<br>
				The innocence, the dreams of every man<br>
				I am the empty crib of Peter Pan<br>
				A silent kite against the blue, blue sky,<br>
				Every chimney, every moonlit sight<br>
				I am the story that will read you real,<br>
				Every memory that you hold dear</p>
			<p>I am the journey
				I am the destination
				I am the home
				The tale that reads you
				A way to taste the night
				The elusive high
				Follow the madness
				Alice you know once did</p>
			<p>Imaginarium, a dream emporium
				Caress the tales
				And they will dream you real
				A storyteller's game
				Lips that intoxicate
				The core of all life
				Is a limitless chest of tales</p>
			<p>I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
				The innocence, the dreams of every man
				I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
				A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
				Every chimney, every moonlit sight
				I am the story that will read you real
				Every memory that you hold dear</p>
			<p>I am the voice of Never-Never-Land
				The innocence, the dreams of every man
				Searching heavens for another Earth</p>
